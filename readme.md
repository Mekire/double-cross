<p><strong>Unlike your common unilateral falling block games, 'Double Cross' implements a bidirectional paradigm expanding the genre in both dimension and difficulty. </strong></p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Overview:</strong></p>
<p>Blocks fall from the top and fly in from the side settling in a joined "play area".&nbsp; Deletions occur when rows of ten blocks are completed. A horizontal row of 10 will cause the blocks to fall down, and a vertical row of 10 will cause the blocks to "fall" to the right.&nbsp; If a vertical row is completed during a vertical drop or a horizontal row is completed during a horizontal drop the corresponding deletion will not occur until the next turn.&nbsp; This can and will lead to non-intuitive results.&nbsp; Focus on the vertical alone and you will die from horizontal negligence and vice versa.</p>
